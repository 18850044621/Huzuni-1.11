(This will be updated when the mod is completely updated)

You are free to use Huzuni source under the following conditions:
- Your project cannot be called Huzuni or any variation (e.g. Huzuni Reloaded, Huzuni2, Newzuni, etc.)
- Your project must be open-source
- You must give credit
- You cannot ask for donations or make money from the project if it uses the source.

In other words:
You're free to fork the mod and make changes, as long as you give the mod a different name, keep it open source, and don't make money off of it.

Again, these terms will be updated a bit when the mod is fully released.
