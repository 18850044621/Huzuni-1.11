#Huzuni (Forge 1.11.2)

A full rewrite of Huzuni is in the works, but in the meantime, here is an updated version of the last version that was released.  Once things are stable, there will be a downloadable version - just have to fix some things first.

The mod is now using Forge, with the help of the [Mixin](https://github.com/spongepowered/mixin) library to make editing Minecraft files significantly easier.

The rewrite will be hosted on a separate repository when it's ready - it will also be using Forge, but is going to be written in Kotlin.  How exciting!
